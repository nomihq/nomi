### ü§î Why Nomi?

In a world where data ownership is challenging and AI is changing how we communicate, Nomi acts as a bridge between your private data and AI capabilities. It supports both local and external providers, including OpenAI, OpenRouter, and Ollama.

While external providers involve sending data externally, Nomi also works with local providers like Ollama, ensuring you retain control over your data. Our aim is to democratize AI by making it more accessible and user-friendly for everyone.

**Looking Ahead**

We're building the Nomi runtime quickly, but our journey doesn't stop there. Soon, we'll expand Nomi into a full AI platform designed to bridge the gap for non-technical users. Our goal is to make advanced AI accessible and easy to use for everyone, enabling you to benefit from AI without the need for technical expertise.

### üíº Use Cases

- **Personal AI Assistant**
- **Voice-Controlled AI Interaction**
- **Workflows and Automation**
- **Privacy-Focused Data Analysis**

And many more! With Nomi's flexible and extensible architecture, you can create your own use cases.

List your installed use cases using the `nomi usecases list` or `nomi u list` command.

### üîß Compile from Source

```shell
git clone https://github.com/nullswan/nomi.git
cd nomi
./hack/install-deps.sh
make build
```

## üîå Enable Providers

We recommend using Ollama is you are concerned about privacy. OpenAI if you are not concerned about privacy and pricing but rather want high performance and have decent internet connection. OpenRouter if you want to switch between providers easily and maintain an efficiency balance.

### üåê Ollama

You can install Ollama from [https://ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download) or it will be automatically installed with Nomi.

For now, we support text LLM through Ollama. Voice and other features are coming soon.

### ü§ñ OpenAI

Every feature supports OpenAI. You can enable it by setting the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable and launch Nomi.

You can create an API key from the [OpenAI dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

### üîó OpenRouter

OpenRouter is a multi provider API. We recommend using it for ease of provider switching.

For now, we support text LLM through OpenRouter. Voice and other features are coming soon.

You can enable it by setting the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable and launch Nomi.

You can create an API key from the [OpenRouter dashboard](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys).

```shell
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```
